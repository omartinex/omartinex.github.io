        <p class="lead">It's surprising how some vulnerabilities are as easy as knowing a number. Let's dive into this straightforward trick in the XYZ Bank's mobile app.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        
        <h2>The Trick Revealed</h2>
        <p>
            So, here's the low-hanging fruit in the world of hacking. If you know a user's national ID number, say "12345678," you can get their data by encoding it in Base64 with the prefix "01-". That's it! It's as simple as that.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            While the data might not be super sensitive, it's concerning how such a straightforward method can grant access. It's a wake-up call for institutions like XYZ Bank to tighten their security, even for seemingly minor details.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Low-Hanging Fruits in Security</h2>
        <p>
            This is a classic example of how some vulnerabilities are like low-hanging fruits. They're easy to spot and exploit, reminding us all to stay vigilant and not overlook even the simplest of issues.
